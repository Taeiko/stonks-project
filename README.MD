# $TONKS

this is a basic stock porfolio tracker app that i made for my final projeject at GA. the purpose of this project is to allow the user to create their own stock portfolio and track the curent prices of the stocks they own.



## tech used to make this project
- Python
- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Finnhub API




## Features
- make your own stock porfolio
- track the current prices of your stocks in real time
- see the total earnings of your entire portfolio


### How to use $TONKS
- sign up and create an account
- Log into your newly made account
- List your own stocks by filling the stock list form 



## Colnclusion
Overall, it was a much more pleasant experience working with python and django compared to the MERN stack since the frontend and backend are all in the same file, performing full CRUD and setting up the API while proved to be a challenge at times, was easily manageable.
